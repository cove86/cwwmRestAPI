Inital set up of a RestAPI for an app I am creating, using Java Spring Boot & Maven as the build tool & postgres as the database. Set up using DTO pattern.

This is the basic set up of the API as initial test to get a base to work from, I am currently learning about Spring Security (hence this being commented out) to secure the API and will update how user log in and registration is handled so that this is secure.
